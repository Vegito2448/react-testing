# React Testing Project

This project is focused on learning how to test React applications using **Vitest**, **React Testing Library**, and **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using `pnpm`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-testing.git
cd react-testing
pnpm i
```

## Running the Project

To run all the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Testing Tools

### Vitest

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a blazing fast unit testing framework powered by Vite. It is designed to be easy to use and integrates well with modern front-end tools.

### React Testing Library

[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) provides simple and complete testing utilities that encourage good testing practices. It helps test React components by focusing on how the user interacts with them.

### Mock Service Worker (MSW)

[Mock Service Worker (MSW)](https://mswjs.io/) is a library for seamless API mocking. It allows you to mock network requests in both client and server-side environments, making it easier to write tests for applications that rely on external APIs.

## Writing Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Example Test with React Testing Library

Here's a simple example of how to write a test using React Testing Library and Vitest:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
import App from './App';

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
